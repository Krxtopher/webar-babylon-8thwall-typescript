# Babylon, 8thWall, TypeScript Template

*A web augmented reality (AR) template using Babylon.js (3D engine), 8th Wall (AR tracking), and TypeScript.*



## Prerequisites

- An [8th Wall](https://www.8thwall.com/) developer account
- NPM installed
- (Recommended) VS Code



## Local Dev Environment Setup

1. After cloning this repository, open an Terminal window and navigate to the repository root folder.
2. Install project dependencies by running:

```
npm install
```



## 8th Wall Setup

1. Log into the 8th Wall developer console and create a new project.
2. Authorize one or more mobile devices to access that project.
3. Edit line 29 of the `public/index.html` file to include the app key from your 8th Wall project. The project's app key can be found on the "Settings" tab within the project on the 8th Wall developer portal.



## Building and Distributing the Application

To build a distributable version of the application run:

```
npm build
```

This will generate a distributable build to a folder called `dist/`. Deploy the files in this folder to a publicly accessible web server.

> :bulb: Tip: [AWS Amplify](https://aws.amazon.com/amplify/) provides a fantastic, easy solution for hosting web apps like this one!



## Using the App

From one of the mobile devices you authorized above, visit the URL of your deployed application.

> :pencil2: Note: Alternatively, you can open the URL in a desktop browser. It will automatically display a QR code that can be scanned from your authorized device.

Upon loading the app, you will be prompted to allow the app to access the motion sensors and camera on your device.

After approving sensor access, you will see a camera view with a yellow target in the middle. Aim your camera wherever you would like to place the sample AR object and click the "Place Object" button.

### Magic URL Parameters

Appending the query parameter `?debug=1` to the URL when loading the website will add a small message panel to the top of the screen to display any log messages written to the JavaScript console via `console.log()` and similar console API calls.



## Customizing the App

To start adding your own custom functionality to the app, you'll likely want to modify the `DemoScene.ts` file.
